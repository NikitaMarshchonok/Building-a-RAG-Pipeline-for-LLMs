Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they have a major limitation: their knowledge is static and limited to the data they were trained on. 
This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in. So, if you want to learn how to enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant external knowledge before generating responses, this article is for you. 
I’ll take you through building a RAG Pipeline for LLMs using Hugging Face Transformers and Python.


Summary
In this article, we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for LLMs using:
  Wikipedia as an external knowledge base
  Sentence Transformers for embedding generation
  FAISS for fast and efficient retrieval
  Hugging Face’s QA pipeline to extract final answers!
